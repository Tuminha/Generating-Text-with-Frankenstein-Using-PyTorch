## How to Download

### Option 1: Direct Download from Project Gutenberg

1. Visit: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84
2. Click **"Plain Text UTF-8"** format
3. Save the file as `frankenstein.txt` in this directory (`datasets/`)

### Option 2: Using wget (Command Line)

```bash
cd datasets/
wget https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-0.txt -O frankenstein.txt
```

### Option 3: Using curl (Command Line)

```bash
cd datasets/
curl https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-0.txt -o frankenstein.txt
```

### Option 4: Using Python

```python
import urllib.request

url = "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-0.txt"
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, "datasets/frankenstein.txt")
print("Downloaded frankenstein.txt")
```

## File Verification

After downloading, verify the file:

```bash
cd datasets/
ls -lh frankenstein.txt
```

Expected:
- **Size**: ~440 KB (450,000+ characters)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 plain text

### Quick Check

```python
with open('datasets/frankenstein.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f.read()
    print(f"Total characters: {len(text)}")
    print(f"First 100 chars: {text[:100]}")
```

You should see:
```
Total characters: ~450000
First 100 chars: The Project Gutenberg eBook of Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus...
```

## What the Notebooks Use

The notebooks train on **Letter 1 only** (a subset of the full text):

```python
with open('datasets/frankenstein.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    frankenstein = f.read()

first_letter_text = frankenstein[1380:8230]  # ~6,850 characters
```

**Why just Letter 1?**
- Fast training (~seconds per epoch)
- Quick iteration for learning
- Sufficient to demonstrate concepts

**Extension:** Remove the slice to train on the full novel (requires ~10x longer training).
